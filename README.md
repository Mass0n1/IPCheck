# IPCheck
A (internal) network continuity check code.
I will still update this repository with an interface, but the idea of this program is basically to type an ip
Example: 192.168.0.1

And it will continuously check every 10 minutes which devices are online on the network.
And as soon as a disconnected machine is detected, it will send an email informing the situation with the date and time of the event.

However, they will implement a change, where he will make a report at the end of the day with all the information.
